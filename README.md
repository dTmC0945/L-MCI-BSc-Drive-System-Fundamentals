### Assignments

There will be one (**1**) assignment and one (**1**) exam for this
course.

The grade breakdown is as follows:

| DEFINITION            | GRADE (%) |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Individual Assignment | 40        |
| Final Exam            | 60        |

## Code Supplement

The Code supplement is a Github webpage dedicated to hosting all the
relevant code used in the lecture as it is not feasible to fit all the
content of the code to the slides and it is easier to share this way.
